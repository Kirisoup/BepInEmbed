# BepInEmbed

A BepInEX plugin that implements loading plugin dependency directly from embedded resource.

Inspired heavily from [Costura](https://github.com/Fody/Costura).

## Why?
Because IL merging is a pain. Fody.Costura is very comfy to use, tho it does not support 
loading bepinex plugins, as expected.
